# OneLink Pay — Proof Pack (payments, policy, and cross-chain)

> Last updated: 2026-07-13 · One page a judge can open and verify independently.
> Backs ledger claims **C21, C25, C26, and C27**. Every tx below is on a public mainnet explorer.

## The two bounded cross-chain claims we make

> A cross-chain USDC payment settles live via a Magic-signed Particle Universal Account in
> EIP-7702 mode: a merchant is paid 1.0 USDC on **Arbitrum** with ~0.12 USDC sourced cross-chain
> from **Base** in the same operation — no manual bridge.

For the integrated Expense Card (C27), we separately claim that a completed Particle activity used
a successful Base source leg to make the 2 USDC budget available and approve it to SpendPolicy on
Arbitrum. We do **not** claim that the later resource purchases were cross-chain or that the entire
2 USDC originated on Base.

## Evidence A — cross-chain settlement (proof-lab run)

A Magic-signed UA in EIP-7702 mode pays the merchant **1.0 USDC on Arbitrum**, sourcing USDC
cross-chain from **Base** in one operation. Verified on-chain (RPC + explorers).

## Evidence B — end-to-end through the product (`/pay`)

Invoice `fc5adc83` paid through the live product on the **stable SDK 2.0.3** (2026-07-06). Funded
from **Base (8453)**, settled on **Arbitrum (42161)** — recorded with the true funding source. The
InvoicePaid attestor is the relayer key, **distinct from the merchant payee** (R26). RPC-verified.

| Field | Value |

## Evidence C — Research Agent Expense Card (`/agent`)

A deterministic research workflow received a signed `0.10 USDC/tool` mandate, bought the two inputs
required to produce an ETH market-risk brief, and was prevented from buying an unexpected premium
export. The payer then revoked the mandate on-chain.

| Step | Public evidence |
|---|---|
| Market insight, `0.05 USDC` | [Arbitrum tx `0xbe1b…d7eb3`](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xbe1b718305fd60b228e27c44156678e2c13fd1714510d8b9a02aa161814d7eb3) |
| Sentiment feed, `0.08 USDC` | [Arbitrum tx `0xfaa2…54aa8`](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xfaa29913ae64dd0731b21758d58529d5f08e7b007e306c282b05012661254aa8) |
| Unexpected premium export, `0.20 USDC` | Rejected as `PerChargeExceeded` before broadcast; on-chain state remained `0.13 USDC` spent |
| Budget revoke | [Arbitrum tx `0xe01a…d5aea`](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xe01a85f70d25acbda2d54f1dbe4350a055c0cf567658b0dbe015e643a3cd5aea), successful `MandateRevoked` |

The resource payloads and brief generation are deterministic demo fixtures; no LLM reasoning or
live market-data quality is claimed. The two settlements, over-cap enforcement, and revoke are real.
These purchases are same-chain Arbitrum operations. Evidence A-B is the separate Particle UA
cross-chain track proof.

---

## Evidence D — integrated Expense Card funding (`/agent`)

Before the card was armed, Particle UA assembled its **2 USDC Arbitrum daily budget** through one
completed activity with a successful Base source leg. OneLink's server then verified every reported
operation receipt, the exact Arbitrum USDC approval to SpendPolicy, and the destination balance
before storing immutable evidence.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Payer (Magic EOA, 7702-delegated) | `0x53Bd615635Af778e5E460d5EEC2d6b234693206a` |
| Budget / exact SpendPolicy approval | 2.00 USDC (`2,000,000` atomic) on Arbitrum |
| Particle activity | [`0x06567b3a8eed3a`](https://universalx.app/activity/details?id=0x06567b3a8eed3a), `FINISHED` |
| **Base source tx** | [`0x3ef6…6f98`](https://basescan.org/tx/0x3ef6e679b185fd1506e1632a313ee2ba0eb147b1be420ab3df687884f3396f98), successful |
| **Arbitrum approval tx** | [`0x0ca4…eb7`](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x0ca454698c355895be5027c4ed8d7d72c8d966c00ca703775e014ea180061eb7), successful |
| SpendPolicy | `0x9782e3724859469fbBAC5085EA8bf8E70724164E` |
| Stored verifier result | `cross_chain=true`, `source_chain_ids=[8453]`, balance and allowance both `2,000,000` atomic |

Funding and spending are deliberately separate proofs. Evidence D proves the cross-chain card
funding/approval operation. Evidence C proves the two later same-chain Arbitrum purchases, policy
block, and revoke.

## Verify it yourself (60 seconds)

1. Open the Arbitrum settlement tx → confirm a USDC `Transfer` of 1.0 to the merchant, status success.
2. Open the Base source / proof tx → confirm the same operation's Base leg.
3. Open the UniversalX activity link → see the cross-chain orchestration as one transaction.
4. Open the public receipt → it cross-checks the on-chain settlement against the invoice and shows
   the InvoicePaid attestation, with no account required.
5. Open the Expense Card Particle activity plus its Base and Arbitrum operation links → confirm the
   funding leg and exact SpendPolicy approval before looking at the later same-chain purchases.

## What's real / pattern / future (read before the pitch)

| Claim | Status |
|---|---|
| Cross-chain USDC settlement via Particle UA + EIP-7702, no manual bridge | **Real, live, on-chain (C21)** |
| On-chain spend mandate (per-charge/daily/total/expiry/merchant/revoke), over-cap reverts at zero gas | **Real, live + 22 contract tests** |
| Walletless login (Magic email/Google) | **Real, live** |
| x402 agent loop (402 → pay → 200; over-cap blocked) | **Real — x402 *pattern*, `onelink-mandate` settled (NOT Coinbase facilitator-compatible)** |
| Research Agent task result | **Real deterministic demo result (C25)** — two paid inputs produced the brief; the data fixtures are not claimed as live market research |
| Integrated Research Agent card funding | **Real, live, server-verified (C27)** — completed Particle activity with a Base source leg and exact 2 USDC Arbitrum SpendPolicy approval; later purchases are separate same-chain operations |
| The "agent" | **Real unattended deterministic loop** — one click; it works through the x402 APIs within budget and is halted by the firewall on the over-cap call. NOT LLM-driven (no AI decision-making claimed); on-chain enforcement is real |
| Gas abstraction (network fee paid in USDC, no destination-chain gas) | **Real, live** — and the one-time 7702 delegation is relayer-sponsored (C23), so a first-time payer needs zero native gas |
| Zero-gas onboarding (one-time 7702 delegation relayer-sponsored) | **Real, live (C23)** — payer needs zero native gas; scoped to the delegation step |
| General gas paymaster (settlement fees) | **Not claimed** — settlement fee paid in USDC by the UA; account is paymaster-compatible |
| Circle Gateway / ZeroDev / Openfort | **Not integrated** — narrative / prior-art. Session keys (ZeroDev) are the production primitive we'd adopt to *arm* unattended automation |

## Notes for the team (not for judges)

- Use **invoice `fc5adc83`** as the product cross-chain example: stable SDK 2.0.3, 2 USDC,
  `source_chain_id` = `8453` (Base → Arbitrum), and the InvoicePaid attestor is the relayer key
  (distinct from the merchant payee — R26).
- Older cross-chain runs (`40027dcf` on beta-3, `7be9118e`) remain valid on-chain but predate the
  stable-SDK + attestor-split; prefer `fc5adc83` in any public material.
- All claims trace to `docs/honest-claim-ledger.md`. This page adds no new claim.
